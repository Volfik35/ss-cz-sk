Although you can upload any dimension file, the auto sizing function will limit the width of the file in proportion to its height, and the file will be repeated to fill the background.  If you choose to add a color code instead, simply enter the six-digit hexadecimal representation of color without the '#' sign in front, or you can simply click on a color from the drop down field.  To switch between images and color, simply browse for a new file to upload, highlight and delete the color code if one was there before, and click edit group.
